About this project:

This project is homework assignment number one. In this assignment I completed a code refactor. From our initial instructions and guides, I broke my project down into buckets. These are the items I was looking for and/or completing: 

1. Clean it up the code
2. Ensure it is not dry code
3. Include the notes, what is it doing? HTML and CSS
4. Ensure people with disabilities can access a website (do audio)
5. Create a solid read me file including what features you put in for accessibility
6. Make sure all of the links are functioning correctly 
7. Consolidate CSS selectors and properties
8. Include comments before each section or element.


This was the original user story I was given: 


## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## This is how I broke this user story down: 
---- broke this down to: 
Lets Map out the Acceptance Criteria: 
1.	We are given the site with accessibility standards. In this site we need to ensure ……
a.	When I look at the source code that it contains semantic HTML elements (Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Elements such as <header> , <footer> and <article> are all considered semantic because they accurately describe the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them.)
b.	When I look at the HTML elements I find that they are placed in a logical structure, independent of the styling and positioning. This means, the CSS styling and positioning should be contained on a styles page. 
c.	When I view the image elements I find accessible alt attributes. This mean, each image has the Alt image telling them what it is. 
d.	When I view the heading attributes (HTML) they fall in sequential order. 
e.	When I view the title element, I find it is a concise and descriptive title. 

Doing this project, I learned the following: 
1. Slow down when reviewing images. These are sneaky and a small little item can be missing on the end that will not make the image loading fail.
2. How to conslidate properties.
3. When and how to commit frequently. 


Here was what I was shooting for: 

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
